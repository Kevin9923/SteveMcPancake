			I was born in 1999 in a caring family and since that time<br>
		    I have had a great desire to create something remarkable. This is the reason<br>
		    why 18 year later 
		    I joined to one of the highest prestige institution,<br>
		    Budapest University of Technology and Economics

		       Recently I have started my work in SpaceX company. <br>

			Our current goal is to create a thruster which returns to the ground, tank itself,<br>
			 and fly to the desired place automatically.
			<br>
			In this difficult task it is my task to coordinate a team of 15 people.
